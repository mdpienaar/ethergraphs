I get an uncomfortable feeling about this project, because my email to the owner could not be delivered.
The Contract Address of Africahead Ipparts (AFA), erc20 token, 0xfB48E0DEa837f9438309a7e9F0cFe7EE3353A84e,
links to the url: ethergraphs.com, on my computer, which can also not be accessed. After searching on the
Internet, i came accross information stating this project blacklists other projects, which is a mafia,
extortionist methodology to make money.

Please give me some assurance i should not get the uncomfortable feeling i am getting.
